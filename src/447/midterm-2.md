Completeness  (Metric Space)
: A metric space $(S, d)$ is complete is every Cauchy Sequence converges in $S$

Cauchy Sequence
: A sequence $S_n$ is Cauchy, iff $\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists N(\epsilon): \forall m, n > N, |d(S_n, S_m)| = 0$

Open (Metric space)
: Let $(S, d)$ be a metric space, $C \subseteq S$. Then $C$ is closed iff $\forall x \in C, \exists r > 0, B_r(x) \subseteq C$

Closed (Metric Space)
: A set is closed if it's complement is open.

Note: $\phi$ and $S$ are both open and closed.
