For any map $f: S^n \to S^n$, there is an induced map from
$f_*: \reduced H_n(S^n) \to \reduced H_n(S^n)$. For a generator $g \in H_n(S^n)$, we have
$f_*: g \mapsto gn$ where $n \in \Z$. We define $n$ as the degree of $f$.

a.  $\deg \id = 1$
b.  $\deg f = 0 \implies f$ not surjective.
c.  $f \homotopic g \implies \deg f = \deg g$
d.  $\deg f g = \deg f \deg g$
e.  $\deg f = -1$ for reflections
f.  $\def -\id = (-1)^{n+1}$
g.  No fixed points implies $\deg f = (-1)^{n+1}$ (and homotopic to the antipodal map)
