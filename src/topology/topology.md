Linear Homotopy, re-parameterization
:   When two paths are the same except for the "speed" at which they move

### Homotopic-equivalent vs Homeomorphic

Let $X$ be the letter $\mathsf{X}$ and $Y$ be the letter $\mathsf{Y}$
Then $X$ and $Y$ are homotopy-equivalent, but they are not homeomorphic.

**Sketch proof:** let $f:X\to Y$ map three of the prongs of the
$\mathsf{X}$ on to the $\mathsf{Y}$ in the obvious way, and let it map
the fourth prong to the point at the centre. Let $g:Y\to X$ map the
$\mathsf{Y}$ into those three prongs of the $\mathsf{X}$. Then $f$ and
$g$ are both continuous, and $f$ is a surjection but is not injective,
while $g$ is an injection but is not surjective. Now the compositions
$f\circ g$ and $g\circ f$ are both easily seen to be homotopic to the
identities on $X$ and $Y$, so $X$ and $Y$ are homotopy-equivalent.
In other words, observe that $\mathsf Y$ is a *deformation retract* of
$\mathsf X$. Alternatively, observe that $\mathsf X$ and $\mathsf Y$
both retract on to the point at the centre.

On the other hand, $X$ and $Y$ are not homeomorphic. For example,
removing the point at the centre of the $\mathsf{X}$ yields a space with
four connected components, while removing any point from the
$\mathsf{Y}$ yields at most three connected components.
