X contractible => id map is homotopic to the constant map

c_t : X \to X, is a continuous family of maps such that
c_0 = id
c_1 = x \mapsto pt

then f \compose c_t is null homotopic

In particular, id: X -> X is null homotopic

f: S -> X homtopic to
p: S -> pt in X

h_t: X -> Y         h_1 = f
                    h_0 = p

i.e. h: C \times I -> Y

Consider, h / (theta, 0). Since h_0 is a constant map, we can still thing of
this as a map from C \times I -> Y.

Consider the inclusion of a non-trivial loop in X into X. This is a map
from C to X. By hypothesis, this extends to a map to a map from the disk to X

Consider the disk in polar coordinates, with the path identified at its boundary.

Then
