1.  a.  $\R^3$ deform retracts to a point, so it's fundamental group is trival.
        If there is a retract ffrom $\S^1$ (or any homeomorphic space)
        then there must be an injection from the its fundamental group $\Z$
        to the trivial group. But this isn't possible, so there cannot be such a retract.

    b.  Again, $\D^2 \times \D^2$ deform retracts to a point.
        and $\S^1 \wedge \S^1$ has a non-trivial fund g.

    c.  Consider the CW complex of a mobius band as a rectangle with one pair of opposite sides
        identified in opposite orientations.
        
        The strip deform retracts to the diagonal. Now, the image of the boundary
        under this retract is $d^2$ where $d$ is a path along the diagnal.
        
        Suppose that there is a retract $r$, from the strip to the boundary, 
        (who's fundamental group is $\Z$). There must be an injection from the
        boundary to the fundamental group ...
        
        Under that injection, its generator, the boundary circle, maps to $d^2$.
        Under the retraction to the boundary, this takes $

        i_b: B -> M         i_b* : FG(B) -> FG(M)   generator |-> i_d*([d^2])
        i_d: D -> M         i_d* : FG(D) -> FG(M)   isomorphism
        
        A retraction from $B -> M$, would map the diagonal $d$ to some loop. This loop
        must be generated by the boundary circle. But under the inclusion map,
        that would mean that $d^2$ is generates $d$! $\Z$ is the free group on one
        generator so that makes no sense!
